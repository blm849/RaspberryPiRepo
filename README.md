# RaspberryPiRepo
A repository for files related to my working on the Raspberry Pi

I wanted to have a repository to share any files or information pertaining to work I am doing with the Raspberry Pi

The config.txt file is one I used with an old Raspberry Pi to send composite/component video output (i.e. not HDMI) to an old Toshiba TV. Details on the set up can be found here: https://smartpeopleiknow.com/2017/04/18/how-to-get-a-raspberry-pi-working-with-a-tv-with-compositecomponent-input-as-opposed-to-hdmi/

The Python programs are sample code to perform various actions on the Raspberry Pi. See the comments in the .py programs for more information.
